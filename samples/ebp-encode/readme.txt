DO NOT USE THESE IN YOUR EAGLERCRAFT RESOURCE PACK, THEY WILL NOT RENDER CORRECTLY!

EAGLERCRAFT EXPECTS PNGs IN RESOURCE PACKS TO BE IN LabPBR FORMAT!

These are meant to be encoded to EBP and placed in the "assets/eagler/glsl/deferred/assets_pbr" directory of assets.epk

Only for client development!
